            <h1>What does therapy look like?</h1>

            <h2>Adolescents</h2>
            <p>Being a teenager today is tough. Pressure from school, friends, family, and social media can feel overwhelming. I create a safe, supportive space where teenagers can talk openly, sort through challenges, and build skills to navigate life with more confidence. After a long day at school, sitting and talking to someone about your feelings may not be for everyone; I also offer walk-and-talk or outdoor sessions, so therapy doesn’t always have to mean sitting still in an office.</p>

            <h2>Individual Counseling</h2>
            <p>Stress, anxiety, anger, depression, or a sense of being stuck can all make life feel overwhelming at times. In our work together, I provide a supportive space to sort through what’s happening and move toward greater balance. I draw on Carl Jung’s idea of individuation, the process of becoming more fully yourself, which means our work is not just about reducing symptoms, but also about uncovering strengths, integrating different parts of who you are, and living with more authenticity and purpose.</p>

            <h2>Children of Divorce (Adolescent and Adult)</h2>
            <p>Divorce can leave lasting ripples, whether you’re an adolescent caught between parents, or an adult still carrying the impact years later. I help clients make sense of those experiences, navigate complicated family dynamics, and begin to heal the wounds of feeling split or unseen. Together, we work on building a stronger sense of self and healthier relationships moving forward.</p>

            <h2>Video Game and Social Media Addiction</h2>
            <p>Does it feel like you’ve lost your child to video games? Or like you’re losing your own time and life to them? Gaming can be fun and social, but when it starts to take over, it can hurt school, work, relationships, and self-esteem. In therapy, we’ll look at what’s driving the pull to escape into games identify other ways to cope, connect, and create balance. The goal isn’t just less screen time, it’s building a fuller, more satisfying life offline.</p>
            <p>Similarly, does scrolling leave you feeling drained, anxious, or like life is slipping by while you’re stuck on your phone? Social media can help us connect, but when it starts taking over, it can hurt confidence, relationships, and peace of mind. In therapy, we’ll explore what’s driving the endless scroll, and work on ways to set healthier boundaries, rebuild presence of mind, and feel more grounded in your daily life.</p>

            <h2>Life Transitions</h2>
            <p>Big changes can bring uncertainty and stress, whether it’s graduating, moving, changing careers, or ending a relationship. I help clients process these shifts, make sense of what’s ending, and step into what’s next with more clarity and confidence. Therapy offers a space to pause, reflect, and chart a new path forward.</p>
